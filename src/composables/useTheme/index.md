# useTheme

## Usage

`useTheme` is a responsive `Bitable` theme, which listens to the theme changes of `Bitable` and updates in real time.

::: tip
Since the `API` of `Bitable` does not support plugins to modify the theme, `useTheme` returns a **read-only** `ref` here, which is **not modifiable**.
