# useEnv

## Usage

`useEnv` is a wrapper of [`getEnv`](https://lark-base-team.github.io/js-sdk-docs/en/api/bridge#getenv), used to get the current environment information. It can be used to determine whether the current environment is in a `Bitable`. Its value is `null` in a `non-Bitable` environment.
