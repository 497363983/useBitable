# What is useBitable

:::warning
This library is still in early development.
:::

`useBitable` is inspired by [UIBuilder](https://bytedance.feishu.cn/docx/Dt2hdGiHtoP7jrx23N7cPqGBnWg) and [Vueuse](https://vueuse.org/), aiming to wrap [JS SDK](https://lark-base-team.github.io/js-sdk-docs/en/) of Feishu Official based on [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html) of [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/), provide some useful [Composables](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html#composables), and provide an [element-plus](https://element-plus.org/en-US/) version of `UIBuilder`, providing a more convenient way for users to build UI and plugin logic.

:::tip
Although this library tries its best to make the development experience friendly to novices, it is undeniable that using this library requires a certain foundation of `Vue` and `TypeScript`. If you are not familiar with `Vue` and `TypeScript`, it is recommended to learn relevant knowledge first.
