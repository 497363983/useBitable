# What is useBitable

:::warning
This library is still in early development.
:::

`useBitable` is inspired by the official [`UIBuilder`](https://bytedance.feishu.cn/docx/Dt2hdGiHtoP7jrx23N7cPqGBnWg) of Feishu, which aims to encapsulate the official [`JS SDK`](https://lark-base-team.github.io/js-sdk-docs/en/) of Feishu based on [`Vue`](https://vuejs.org/) [`Composition API`](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html), provide some useful [`Composables`](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/reusability-composables.html), and provide an [`element-plus`](https://element-plus.org/en-US/) version of `UIBuilder` to provide users with a more convenient way to build UI and plugin logic.

:::tip
Although this library tries to make the development experience friendly to novices, it is undeniable that using this library requires a certain foundation of `Vue` and `TypeScript`. If you are not familiar with `Vue` and `TypeScript`, it is recommended to learn the relevant knowledge first.
